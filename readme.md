# BB16-Schemer

BB16-Schemer is a bb16 wrapper to manage a group of template

## Motivation

This project followed an idea I got for base16-builder. You can read the whole discussion at this [base16-builder's issue](https://github.com/alexbooker/base16-builder/issues/20).

## Caveas

This project is written in Bash. I want to move it to JavaScript to be coherent with [base16-builder](https://github.com/alexbooker/base16-builder). I will rewrite it when a core library would be available ([see #50](https://github.com/alexbooker/base16-builder/issues/50)).
